Write what's it? how to run the dart program? how to compile the dart cli executable"},{"role":"assistant","content":"Sure, here's a quick getting started guide for tGPT Github, an open-sourced dart CLI application:\n\nWhat is tGPT Github?\ntGPT Github is an open-sourced dart CLI application that allows you to generate automated text using the GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) language model. This tool uses machine learning algorithms to generate text based on the input provided by the user. It is a useful tool for generating text for a variety of purposes, such as content creation, chatbots, and more.\n\nHow to run the dart program?\nTo run the tGPT Github dart program, you will need to have the Dart SDK installed on your computer. Once you have installed the Dart SDK, follow these steps:\n\n1. Clone the tGPT Github repository from Github.\n2. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the cloned repository.\n3. Run the following command to install the dependencies:\n\n```\ndart pub get\n```\n\n4. After the dependencies are installed, run the following command to start the application:\n\n```\ndart bin/main.dart\n```\n\n5. The application will start running, and you can follow the prompts to generate text.\n\nHow to compile the dart CLI executable?\nTo compile the tGPT Github dart CLI executable, you will need to use the Dart SDK's built-in compiler tool, dart2native. Follow these steps:\n\n1. Open your terminal and navigate to the root directory of the tGPT Github repository.\n2. Run the following command to compile the application:\n\n```\ndart compile exe bin/main.dart\n```\n\n3. The compiler will generate an executable file in the root directory of the repository.\n4. You can run the executable file by navigating to the root directory and running the following command:\n\n```\n./main\n```\n\nThat's it! You should now be able to run and compile the tGPT Github dart CLI application."},{"role":"user","content":"write a markdown table to describe the following commands of terminalGPT     print(\"  -i, --input <input>  Input to the model\");"},{"role":"assistant","content":"| Command | Description |\n| --- | --- |\n| -i, --input <input> | Specifies the input to the model.
